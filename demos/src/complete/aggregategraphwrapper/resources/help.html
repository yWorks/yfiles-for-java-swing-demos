<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  This demo shows how to analyze a graph by <b>aggregating groups of nodes</b>.
</p>

<p>
  Via the context menu, groups of nodes of the same color or shape can be aggregated giving different insights about
  the graph. <br/>For example, aggregating all nodes by <b>color</b> shows that there are no connections between purple
  and green nodes, while blue nodes are connected to both other colors.<br/>
  Aggregating by <b>shape and color</b> shows that there are no connections between rectangle shaped nodes of
  different color and no connections between green nodes of different shape.
</p>

<p>
  The demo makes use of the <code>AggregateGraphWrapper</code> class, that allows
  for aggregating graph items by hiding items and adding new items to a wrapped graph.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Right click on a node to open a <b>popup menu</b> with the different aggregation
    and expansion options..</li>
  <li>Aggregate all nodes with the <b>same shape or color</b> by selecting "Aggregate Nodes with Same ...".</li>
  <li><b>Separate</b> an aggregation node again by selecting "Separate".</li>
  <li>Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Aggregate All Nodes by ..." to
    <b>group all nodes</b> by shape or color.</li>
  <li>Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Separate All" to show the whole tree again.</li>
</ul>
