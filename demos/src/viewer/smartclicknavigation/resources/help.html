<h2>Smart Click Navigation</h2>

<p>This demo shows how to navigate in a large graph, especially when only a part of the graph is visible in the
  viewport. Clicking on items will move the graph so that the mouse pointer now points to a sensible focused item.</p>
<h3>Things To Try</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Click on an <b>edge</b> whose target node or source node is not currently visible in the viewport.
    Then you will notice that the focus will be moved to that previously-invisible node.
  </li>
  <li>Click on an <b>edge</b> where both target and source node are visible. Then you will notice that the focus
    will be moved to the middle point of the edge.
  </li>
  <li>Click on a <b>node</b> and you will notice that the focus will be moved to the center of the clicked node.
  </li>
</ul>
