  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>The Gantt Chart demo shows how to create a Gantt component.</p>
  <p>
    The data consists of tasks which define the horizontal lanes and activities,
    each of which is assigned to a task.
  </p>
  <p>
    An activity has a start and end date, and optionally a lead time and a
    follow-up time. An activity can optionally depend on other activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The activity duration is rendered as a solid area.
    The lead and follow-up times are rendered with a hatch pattern.
  </p>
  <p>Activity dependencies are modeled as edges between the activity nodes.</p>
  
  <h2>Things to Try</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Scroll the tasks using the mouse wheel.</li>
    <li>Scroll the timeline horizontally using shift + mouse wheel.</li>
    <li>Hover over an activity to highlight its dependencies.</li>
    <li>Hover over a dependency edge to highlight the source and target.</li>
    <li>Select an activity to display the activity information.</li>
    <li>
      Grab and drag an activity to change the start and end time, or to assign
      an activity to a different task.
    </li>
    <li>
      Grab the left or right side of the solid area of an activity and drag to
      change the duration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Select an activity and drag one of the handles on the left or right
      to change the lead or follow-up time.
    </li>
    <li>Select an activity and press 'F2' to change its name.</li>
    <li>
      Drag an activity so it overlaps with other activities in the same task
      lane. The activities are placed below each other so they don't overlap.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drag the mouse on an empty part of a task lane to create a new activity.
    </li>
    <li>Shift-drag from a node to create a new dependency edge.</li>
  </ul>
