<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
This demo shows edge-to-edge connections.
The input mode of this demo is configured to allow edges to connect not only to nodes but also to edges.
</p>
<p>
  This application also demonstrates how to provide port candidates at edges to support interactive creation
  of edge-to-edge connections. Please take a look at the code behind to observe some customization
  possibilities.
</p>

<h2>Things to Try</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
      Create a connection between a node and an edge by pressing the left mouse button on an unselected node and dragging
      the edge onto another edge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a connection between two edges by dragging the mouse from an edge onto another edge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hold down the shift modifier when moving the ends of an edge across another edge to create dynamic port candidates
      that best match the mouse location.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start dragging the mouse from various positions on an edge to observe that the best available port location is
      chosen for the source port.
    </li>
    <li>
      Re-connect an existing edge by selecting it and dragging the source or target onto another node or edge.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try to re-connect an edge's source or target to itself or another edge that connects to the edge that is being re-connected.
      There will be no port candidates since connecting an edge to itself or creating a mutual dependency is forbidden in this demo.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Please note that the bend creation gesture has been customized in this demo. Press the Shift button and drag the mouse on an unselected edge
  to create a bend.
