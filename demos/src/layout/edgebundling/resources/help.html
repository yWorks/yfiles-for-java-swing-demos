  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    This demo shows how edge bundling can be applied for reducing visual cluttering in dense graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The edge curves are drawn using piecewise cubic bezier curves with gradient colors from dark-blue (that starts from the
    source node) to light-blue (that leads to the target node of the edge). For the approximation of the edge curves, a
    <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.layout.CurveFittingLayoutStage">yfiles.layout.CurveFittingLayoutStage</a> is applied.
  </p>
  <p>
    For circular layouts, a circular-sector style is used for the visualization of the nodes.
  </p>
  <h2>Things to try:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Edit the demo code and select one of the layout algorithm that support edge bundling by adjusting the demo's <code>selectedAlgorithm</code> constant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Edit the demo code and modify the strength of the bundles by adjusting the demo's <code>bundlingStrength</code> constant. Notice how this change
      influences the shape of the curves of the bundled edges. Values close to <code>1</code> lead to tight bundles, while values
      close to<code>0</code> lead to straight-line non-bundled edges. Values larger than <code>0.85</code> are recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hover over an edge to highlight its path and its source and target nodes. The edges are highlighted also with
      gradient colors from red (source node) to gold (target node).
    </li>
    <li>
      Hover over a node to highlight its incident edges.
    </li>
  </ul>
