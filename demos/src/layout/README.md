# Layout Demos
  

 This folder and its subfolders contain demo applications which make use of the different layout algorithms of the layout component of yFiles for Java (Swing).   

| Demo | Description |
|------|-------------|
|[LayoutStyles](../../src/layout/layoutstyles/)| Play with the most used layout algorithms of yFiles. |
|[HierarchicLayout](../../src/layout/hierarchiclayout/)| Showcase of one of our central layout algorithms, the HierarchicLayout. |
|[InteractiveOrganicLayout](../../src/layout/interactiveorganic/)| Use InteractiveOrganicLayout for organic layout in interactive environments. |
|[FamilyTree](../../src/layout/familytree/)| This demo shows how genealogical graphs (family trees) can be visualized. |
|[MarqueeClearAreaLayout](../../src/layout/cleararea/)| Shows how to interactively move graph elements around a marquee rectangle in a given graph layout so that the modifications in the graph are minimal. |
|[CriticalPaths](../../src/layout/criticalpaths/)| This demo shows how to emphazise important paths with hierarchic and tree layout algorithms. |
|[EdgeBundling](../../src/layout/edgebundling/)| Shows how edge bundling can be applied for reducing visual cluttering in dense graphs. |
|[EdgeGrouping](../../src/layout/edgegrouping/)| Shows the effects of edge and port grouping when arranging graphs with HierarchicLayout. |
|[FillAreaAfterDeletion](../../src/layout/fillarea/)| Shows howto fill free space in the graph after deleting nodes. |
|[NodeTypes](../../src/layout/nodetypes/)| A demo that shows how different layout algorithms handle nodes with types. |
|[OrganicSubstructures](../../src/layout/organicsubstructures/)| Shows how [OrganicLayout](http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.layout.organic.OrganicLayout) handles substructures and node types. |
|[PartialLayout](../../src/layout/partiallayout/)| Shows how to arrange some elements in a graph while keeping other elements fixed. |
|[PartitionGrid](../../src/layout/partitiongrid/)| Demonstrates the usage of a *PartitionGrid* for hierarchic and organic layout calculations. |
|[Sankey](../../src/layout/sankey/)| Showcase of how a Sankey diagram can be produced by means of the HierarchicLayout. |
|[SplitEdges](../../src/layout/splitedges/)| Shows how to align edges at group nodes using RecursiveGroupLayout together with HierarchicLayout. |
|[TreeLayout](../../src/layout/treelayout/)| Demonstrates the tree layout style and the different ways in which this layout can arrange a node and its children. |
|[TreeMap](../../src/layout/treemap/)| Shows disk usage of a directory tree with the Tree Map layout. |
|[LayoutWithoutView](../../src/layout/withoutview/)| Shows how to create a graph, run a graph analysis algorithm, and calculate a layout without using a view or the IGraph API. |
