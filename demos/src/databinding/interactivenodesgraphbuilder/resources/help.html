<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  Shows data binding with class <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.graph.AdjacentNodesGraphBuilder">AdjacentNodesGraphBuilder</a>.
</p>
<p>
  NodesSource defines the basic nodes of the graph. Other nodes can be added by
  the predecessors (successors) binding of already existing node. A node that is
  only defined as predecessor (successor) of another node and not by NodesSource
  itself is removed from the graph if it is removed from the predecessors
  (successors). This may result in the removal of a whole graph component if a
  certain predecessor (successor) connection is removed.

  See the <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/dguide/graph_builder#graph_builder">Creating a Graph from Business Data</a>
  chapter of the Developers Guide for more information.

<h3>Things to Try</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click a node in the graph to make it the current item. Inspect its
    predecessors and successors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the + button of the 'Nodes Source', 'Predecessors' and 'Successors'
    lists to add a new data item which creates a corresponding node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select data in 'Nodes Source' and click the - button to remove it from the
    list. Note that the corresponding node might not be removed if the data is
    still a predecessor (successor) of another item.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select data in 'Predecessors' (Successors) and click the - button to remove
    it from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drag data from the graph to one of the lists.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drag data from the graph into the trash to remove it.
  </li>
</ul>
