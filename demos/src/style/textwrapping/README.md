# Text Wrapping
  

 This demo shows how to enable the text wrapping and trimming feature provided by the `DefaultLabelStyle` class. The options include `TextWrapping` at word bounds and `TextTrimming` with or without ellipsis.   

 Aside from wrapping in rectangular shapes, the `TextWrappingShape` property allows for wrapping in many more shapes like triangle, hexagon or ellipse. This can be combined with `TextWrappingPadding` and `Insets` to fine-tune the wrapping.
