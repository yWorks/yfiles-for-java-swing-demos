 A demo that shows the different node shapes that can be implemented with the `RectangleNodeStyle` class. Several nodes with different RectangleNodeStyle configurations are provided on startup and the configuration of a style can be changed via an option panel. The properties that can be changed include whether corners should be rounded or cut by a diagonal line, which corners should be affected, whether an absolute or relative portion of the corners shall be adjusted (which is mainly important when resizing the node) as well as the value (absolute or relative to the node size) used to calculate the corner radius.
