<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.graph.styles.ShapeNodeStyle">RectangleNodeStyle</a>
    class can display a variety of shapes including rectangles with rounded and cut corners, hexagons,
    octagons, pills, half-circles, and more.
</p>
<p>
    This is made possible by numerous configuration options for the representation of the node
    corners. This demo allows you to interactively explore those options. The current configuration
    of each node is shown as label.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Change some of the settings in the property panel on the right-hand side while a node is
        selected and see how it affects the selected node.
    </li>
    <li>
        Resize a selected node via its rectangular handles and see how the shape changes based on
        the value of <em>Scale Corner Size</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drag the round handle of a selected node to change its <em>Corner Size</em> interactively. A
        blue rectangle will be displayed during the drag that visualizes the top-left corner using
        the current corner size.
    </li>
</ul>
