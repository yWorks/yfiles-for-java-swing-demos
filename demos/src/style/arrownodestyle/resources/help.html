<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
    <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.graph.styles.ArrowNodeStyle">ArrowNodeStyle</a> 
    provides several properties to customize its shape. There are five basic <em>shapes</em>
    provided that can be rotated to point to four <em>directions</em>.
</p>
<p>
    For the <em>Arrow</em>, <em>DoubleArrow</em> and <em>NotchedArrow</em> shapes, the thickness of
    the arrow shaft can be defined as a <em>shaft ratio</em> of the node size.
</p>
<p>
    For all shapes, the <em>angle</em> of the arrow tip can be defined in radians. The angle is
    between an arrow blade and the perpendicular to which the arrow is pointing.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        Select a node and see its style settings in the property panel on the right hand side.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change some of the settings while a node is selected and see how it affects the selected
        node.
    </li>
    <li>
        Resize a selected node via its resize handles and see how the shape changes based on the
        node size ratio.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drag the white rectangular handle of a selected node to change its shaft ratio interactively.
        Note that the shaft ratio cannot be changed for trapezoid or parallelogram shapes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drag the circular handle of a selected node to change its arrow blade angle interactively.
        Note that for trapezoid or parallelogram shapes as well as all styles with a shaft ratio
        value of 1 the angle may be negative to invert the arrow tip.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click on the canvas background to create a new node using the style settings of the property
        panel.
    </li>
</ul>
