            <h3>Maximum Flow</h3>
            The <em>maximum flow</em> problem seeks to determine the maximum load that a network can handle considering
            a capacity constraint. Applications of the maximum flow algorithm include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Determine the maximum amount of data that can be sent through a computer network.</li>
                <li>Find the maximum amount of fluids (e.g. water or oil) that a network of pipelines can supply.</li>
                <li>Calculate the amount of goods that a company can transport from warehouses to stores depending on
                    the number of available trucks and the state of the roads.
                </li>
            </ul>
