            <h3>Minimum Cost Flow</h3>
            The <em>minimum cost flow</em> describes the flow through a network that produces the lowest cost. The
            solution depends on the edges' capacity and cost. Some nodes can supply flow to the network while others can
            demand flow from the network. Applications of the minimum cost algorithm include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Find the parts in pipelines or data networks that handle the most flow and would affect the flow the
                    most when they fail.
                </li>
                <li>Find the most efficient flight passenger lift in which passengers can leave/board the plane at every
                    stop to prevent empty flights.
                </li>
                <li>Find the optimal location for facilities based on their connection with the surrounding neighborhood
                    (e.g. hospitals, fire stations).
                </li>
                <li>Solve the transportation problem where a certain demand of goods must be satisfied by a number of
                    warehouses such that the transportation costs are minimized.
                </li>
