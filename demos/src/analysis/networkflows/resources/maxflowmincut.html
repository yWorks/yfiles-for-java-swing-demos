            <h3>Maximum Flow Minimum Cut</h3>
            The <em>maximum flow minimum cut</em> problem determines the maximum amount of flow that can be sent through
            the network and calculates the <em>minimum cut</em>. A cut separates the network such that source and sink
            nodes are disconnected and no flow from the source can reach the sink. The <em>minimum cut</em> is the cut
            with the minimum capacity and its value equals to the <em>maximum flow</em>. Applications of the maximum
            flow minimum cut algorithm include the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Determine a maximum bipartite matching in a general graph.</li>
                <li>Calculate the maximum flow of a network.</li>
                <li>Find a parking spot for each car that minimizes the total time required for all cars to find a
                    spot.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Take a look at the min-cut line to determine the edges that belong to the cut.
