<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  <em>Network flow</em> algorithms apply to directed networks in which edges have certain capacities and a flow
  moves from source nodes (i.e., nodes with in-degree 0) to sink nodes (i.e., nodes with out-degree 0).
</p>
<p>
  In our everyday life, flow algorithms can be applied to all problem domains that involve networks (e.g., water
  supply, electricity/power, internet, shipment) in which the goal is to move some flow (e.g., water,
  electricity/power, products, internet traffic, message) from one position to another within the network as
  efficient as possible.
</p>
<p>
  The demo presents three flow algorithms that will be applied on a network with water pipes. The thickness of each
  edge indicates the edge capacity while the blue-colored part the flow load. The label of each edge is in form
  "flow / capacity".
</p>
<p>
  The blue part in the interior of each node indicates the flow that comes across the node through the incoming
  edges. Source nodes are bounded by a green rectangle, while sink nodes by a red rectangle. For "Minimum Cost"
  algorithm, source nodes are also the ones that can "supply" flow to the network, while sink nodes are those that
  "demand" flow from the network.
</p>
<p>
  The user can select one of the provided algorithms using the combo-box in the toolbar. The result of each
  algorithm is also visualized in the toolbar. In the case where for some reason, no feasible solution is found, the
  result will be -1.
