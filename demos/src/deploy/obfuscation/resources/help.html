<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  This demo shows how to obfuscate a yFiles for Java (Swing) application.
  <br>
  The obfuscation is done using yGuard, the free bytecode obfuscator that is
  available at
  <a href="https://github.com/yWorks/yGuard">github.com/yWorks/yGuard</a>.
  <br>
  Please see the yGuard documentation hosted at
  <a href="https://yworks.github.io/yGuard/">yworks.github.io/yGuard</a>
  for further information on how to configure and use yGuard.
</p>

<h2>Obfuscation</h2>

<p>
  Obfuscation changes class, field, and method names in a consistent
  but nonsensical way that does not change the functionality of the
  software but makes decompiled Java code harder to read and publicly
  available API description of the original code inapplicable to the
  obfuscated code. Obfuscation is an important step in the process
  of deploying an application in order to protect your software.
  See how to obfuscate the yFiles library.
</p>

<p>
  Since some names need to be kept at runtime in order for Java
  applications to work, yGuard provides several mechanisms to control
  the obfuscation process. In this demo, annotations are used for this.
  Please see
  <a href="https://yworks.github.io/yGuard/task_documentation.html#controlling-obfuscation-exclusion-with-annotations">Controlling obfuscation exclusion with annotations</a>
  in the yGuard documentation for further information.

<h2>The Demo Application</h2>
<p>
  A simple <code>GraphComponent</code> with a trivial graph is shown.
  In the background of the component is a blue rectangle that is positioned and
  sized to match the content rectangle of the component.
</p>
<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create new nodes and see how the background rectangle resizes and repositions accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the <em>show</em> ant task to inspect the obfuscation.
  </li>
</ul>
