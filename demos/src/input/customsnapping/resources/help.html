<h1>Description</h1>
<p>
  Enable and customize the snapping behaviour of graph items.
</p>
<p>
  The snapping feature can be customized, so that it adds snap lines to the bounds of node and edge labels,
  lets star shaped nodes snap to the grid points with their outline and uses free additional snap lines nodes and labels
  can snap to.
</p>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Move the topmost black node and one of the star shaped nodes around and compare their different
        grid snapping behaviour. While the black node only snaps to grid points with its center, the star shaped
        node snaps with all points of its outline, but then again only to the grid points, not in between.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move the unconnected black node close to an orthogonal node or edge label to snap it to the label's bounds.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move an edge label to a non-orthogonal edge segment to disable node snapping for this label.
        Nodes cannot snap to non-orthogonal labels.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move node and edge labels along their owner's border/path to snap them to other particular positions relative to the owner.
    </li>
    <li>
        Move a node close to the red snap lines to snap it to these non-graph elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the position of a red snap line by dragging it around.
    </li>
</ul>
