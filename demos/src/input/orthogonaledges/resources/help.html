<h1>Description</h1>

<p>
  Enable orthogonal edge editing using the <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.view.input.GraphEditorInputMode">GraphEditorInputMode</a>. Customize the behavior by implementing the
  <a href="http://docs.yworks.com/yfilesjava/doc/api/#/api/com.yworks.yfiles.view.input.IOrthogonalEdgeHelper">IOrthogonalEdgeHelper</a> interface and adding instances to the edge decorator of the graph.
</p>
<h2>
    Things to try
</h2>
Drag segments and bends of the edges and observe the different characteristics.
<h2>
  Edge Types
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
      <font color="#b22222"><b>Red edges</b></font> behave like normal edges with no orthogonal editing. The segments are
      straight lines with arbitrary slope. Dragging an unselected segment always creates a new bend.
    </li>
    <li>
      <font color="#228b22"><b>Green edges</b></font> demonstrate the default orthogonal edge editing behavior. While dragging,
      all segments stay orthogonal and new bends are created as needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <font color="#800080"><b>Purple edges</b></font> behave just like green edges except that the locations of the source
      port and target port are constrained to the given port candidates of the nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <font color="#ff8c00"><b>Orange edges</b></font> behave just like green edges except that the source and
      target port can be placed at any location inside the node since they use dynamic port candidates.
    </li>
    <li>
      <font color="#4169e1"><b>Blue edges</b></font> behave just like green edges for the inner segments. The first and
      the last segment can have an arbitrary slope. If a new bend is added to one of these two segments, the newly
      created inner segment becomes orthogonal immediately.
    </li>
</ul>
