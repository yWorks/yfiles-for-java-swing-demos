# yFiles for Java (Swing) Programming Samples

This repository contains source code demos and tutorials that use the commercial
[yFiles for Java (Swing)](https://www.yworks.com/yfilesjava) software programming
library for the visualization of graphs, diagrams, and networks.
The library itself is __*not*__ part of this repository.

# Running the Demos

For most of these demos equivalent ones based on
[yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml) are hosted
[online here](https://live.yworks.com/yfiles-for-html) for everyone to play with.
Developers should
[evaluate the library](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-for-java/evaluate),
instead. The evaluation version also contains these demos and the necessary
library to execute the code.
